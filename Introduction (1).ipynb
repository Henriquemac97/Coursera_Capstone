    "The main motivation of this project is to contribute to a better understanding of how the process of dissemination of **COVID-19** occurred in the world. Many reports are shown daily to update us on the numbers of the disease, but there are no useful **visual tools** to show in a clear and didactic way how this process happened since the beginning, in December 2019.\n",
